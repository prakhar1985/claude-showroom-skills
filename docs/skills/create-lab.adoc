== What It Does

The `/create-lab` skill guides you through creating workshop content with:

* *Sequential questioning* (one question at a time, wait for answer)
* *Automatic file generation* (index, overview, details, modules)
* *Story continuity* across modules
* *Verification checkpoints* in every module
* *Red Hat standards* enforcement
* *Mandatory conclusion* with consolidated references

== When to Use

Create workshop labs when you need:

* *Hands-on learning content* for students/learners
* *Progressive skill building* (beginner → advanced)
* *Step-by-step instructions* with verification
* *Technical training modules* (30-45 minutes each)
* *Lab environments* with guided activities

[NOTE]
====
For presenter-led demonstrations, use link:create-demo.adoc[`/create-demo`] instead. Workshops are learner-focused; demos are presenter-focused.
====

== Before You Start

Have these materials ready:

* *Reference documentation* (official docs, URLs, existing content)
* *Learning objectives* (what should learners achieve?)
* *Target audience* defined (skill level, background)
* *Lab environment* details (if using AgnosticD/RHDP)
* *Technical scope* (what products/features to cover)

[TIP]
====
The skill works best when you have clear learning goals. Spend 10 minutes outlining objectives before starting.
====

== How to Use

=== Start New Workshop Series

[source,bash]
----
# Navigate to your Showroom project
cd ~/showroom-my-workshop

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Create first module
/create-lab --new
----

=== Continue Existing Workshop

[source,bash]
----
# In same project directory
claude

# Add another module
/create-lab --continue
----

== The Workflow

The skill uses a *12-step sequential workflow*. Each step asks questions and waits for your answers.

=== Step 0: Parse Command Arguments

*What happens:*

* Detects `--new` or `--continue` flag
* If no flag, asks whether this is a new workshop or continuation

*Your input:*

* Nothing (if you used flags)
* OR answer: "This is a new workshop" or "Continue existing workshop"

=== Step 1: Determine Workshop Status

*What happens:*

* For new workshops: Proceeds to Step 2
* For continuations: Detects existing modules, skips to Step 3

*Automatic detection:*

----
Scanning content/modules/ROOT/pages/...
Found existing modules:
  ✓ 00-index.adoc
  ✓ 01-overview.adoc
  ✓ 02-details.adoc
  ✓ 03-module-01-setup.adoc

Detected: Continuation (will create module 04)
----

=== Step 2: Plan Overall Workshop Story (New Only)

*What's asked:*

1. *Workshop title*: What is the main topic?
2. *Company scenario*: What fictional company will we use?
3. *Business challenge*: What problem does the company face?
4. *Learning arc*: How will skills progress across modules?
5. *Target duration*: How many modules (and total time)?

*Example answers:*

----
Title: "Deploying Applications on Red Hat OpenShift"
Company: "ACME Retail"
Challenge: "ACME needs to modernize legacy apps for cloud"
Learning arc: "Module 1: Basics → Module 2: Advanced → Module 3: Production"
Duration: "3 modules, ~2 hours total"
----

[NOTE]
====
The skill remembers this story for all subsequent modules. You don't need to repeat it.
====

=== Step 2.5: AgnosticV Catalog (Optional)

*What's asked:*

* "Are you creating this for Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP)?"

*If yes:*

* Skill helps generate `catalog.yaml` for AgnosticV
* Extracts variables from catalog for use in content
* Generates UUIDs for catalog entries

*If no:*

* Skips catalog generation
* Uses placeholder attributes instead

[TIP]
====
Most users select "No" unless deploying to RHDP. You can always add catalog later.
====

=== Step 3: Gather Module-Specific Details

*What's asked:*

1. *Module title*: What will this module teach?
2. *Learning objectives*: List 3-5 specific, measurable outcomes
3. *Prerequisites*: What should learners know beforehand?
4. *Estimated time*: How long will this module take?
5. *Key concepts*: What technical concepts are introduced?

*Example answers:*

----
Module title: "Deploying Your First Application"
Learning objectives:
  - Log into Red Hat OpenShift web console
  - Create new projects with proper naming
  - Deploy applications from Git repositories
  - Verify deployment status using CLI and UI

Prerequisites:
  - Basic Linux command line knowledge
  - Git fundamentals
  - Understanding of containers (helpful but not required)

Time: 30-45 minutes
Key concepts: Projects, Pods, Deployments, Services, Routes
----

=== Steps 4-7: Content Enhancement

*Step 4: Dynamic Variables*

* "What variables should be extracted?" (e.g., `{web_console_url}`, `{username}`)
* Variables go in `partials/_attributes.adoc`

*Step 5: Diagrams*

* "Will this module include diagrams?" (Yes/No)
* If yes: Describes where images should be placed

*Step 6: Troubleshooting*

* "Should we include troubleshooting section?" (Optional for basic modules)
* If yes: Asks for common issues to document

*Step 7: Verification Steps*

* "What should learners verify?" (Mandatory)
* Ensures hands-on checkpoints exist

=== Step 8: Generate Files

*For first module* (`--new`):

Creates 4 files:

----
00-index.adoc           # Landing page with workshop overview
01-overview.adoc        # Company scenario and learning objectives
02-details.adoc         # Technical requirements and prerequisites
03-module-01-*.adoc     # First hands-on module
----

*For continuation* (`--continue`):

Creates 1 file:

----
04-module-02-*.adoc     # Next module in sequence
----

[WARNING]
====
Files are written directly to `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`. Back up existing content before running the skill!
====

=== Step 10: Update Navigation

*What happens:*

* Automatically updates `content/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc`
* Adds new module to navigation menu
* Maintains proper ordering

*Example nav.adoc update:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
* xref:00-index.adoc[Workshop Home]
* xref:01-overview.adoc[Overview]
* xref:02-details.adoc[Technical Details]
* xref:03-module-01-setup.adoc[Module 1: Setup]
* xref:04-module-02-deploy.adoc[Module 2: Deploy]  ← NEW
----

=== Step 12: Generate Conclusion Module

*What's asked* (when you're ready to finish):

* "Is this the final module?" (Yes/No)

*If yes:*

* Generates conclusion module (`0X-conclusion.adoc`)
* Consolidates ALL references from all modules
* Includes key takeaways
* Provides next steps for learners
* Links to Red Hat training/certification

[NOTE]
====
Conclusion modules are *mandatory* in Red Hat workshops. They wrap up the learning journey and consolidate references.

= Module 1: Deploying Your First Application

== Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

* Log into Red Hat OpenShift web console
* Create new projects
* Deploy applications from Git

== Exercise: Deploy Application

. Log into OpenShift web console at {web_console_url}
. Create new project named `my-first-app`
. Deploy from Git repository

=== Verify

Confirm deployment succeeded:

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -n my-first-app
----

Expected: Pod shows STATUS: Running
----

== Key Features

=== 1. Sequential Questioning

[TIP]
====
The skill asks *one question (or related group) at a time* and *waits for your answer*. This prevents overwhelming you with 20 questions at once.
====

*Example interaction:*

----
Skill: "What is the title of this workshop module?"
You: "Deploying Your First Application"

Skill: "What are the learning objectives? (List 3-5)"
You: "1. Log into OpenShift console
      2. Create new projects
      3. Deploy from Git
      4. Verify deployment status"

Skill: "What prerequisites should learners have?"
You: "Basic Linux CLI, Git fundamentals, container concepts"
----

=== 2. Story Continuity

*First module* (using `--new`):

* You define company scenario
* Skill remembers: "ACME Retail needs to modernize apps"

*Second module* (using `--continue`):

* Skill auto-detects: "Continuing ACME Retail story"
* You don't re-explain the scenario
* Seamless narrative across modules

=== 3. Automatic Verification Checkpoints

Every module *must include* verification steps. The skill ensures:

* Learners can check their progress
* Success criteria are clear
* Commands show expected output
* Troubleshooting hints provided (optional)

*Example verification:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
=== Verify Your Deployment

Check that your application is running:

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -n my-app
----

*Expected output:*
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-app-1-xxxxx           1/1     Running   0          2m

✅ *Success*: Pod shows STATUS: Running
❌ *Issue*: If pod shows CrashLoopBackOff, check logs:
   oc logs <pod-name> -n my-app
----

=== 4. AgnosticV Integration (Optional)

For RHDP developers deploying to Red Hat Demo Platform:

*What it does:*

* Generates `catalog.yaml` for AgnosticV repository
* Extracts user_data variables (URLs, credentials, endpoints)
* Creates UUIDs for catalog entries
* Provides git workflow guidance

*Example variable extraction:*

[source,yaml]
----
# From AgnosticV user_data:
user_data:
  web_console_url: "https://console-openshift-console.apps..."
  username: "user1"
  password: "xxxxx"

# Becomes attributes in content:
{web_console_url}
{username}
{password}
----

[NOTE]
====
AgnosticV integration is *optional*. Most workshop creators skip this unless deploying to RHDP.
====

== Best Practices

=== 1. Use Version Attributes

*Don't hardcode versions:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
Install OpenShift 4.18 using...
----

*Use attributes:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
Install Red Hat OpenShift {ocp_version} using...
----

*Why:* Hardcoded versions break when products update. Attributes make content future-proof.

=== 2. Include Verification in Every Module

*Missing verification:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Exercise: Deploy Application

. Create project
. Deploy app
. Done!
----

*Include verification:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Exercise: Deploy Application

. Create project
. Deploy app

=== Verify

Check deployment status:

 oc get pods
Expected: Pod shows Running status
----

*Why:* Learners need checkpoints to confirm understanding before proceeding.

=== 3. Keep Modules Focused (30-45 min)

*Too long (90 min module):*

* Covers 10 different topics
* Learners get fatigued
* Hard to debug issues

*Right size (30-45 min module):*

* 1-2 related topics
* Clear beginning and end
* Manageable troubleshooting

*Why:* Shorter modules improve retention and reduce frustration.

=== 4. Add References for Claims

*Unsupported claim:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
OpenShift is the most popular container platform.
----

*With reference:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
According to link:https://www.redhat.com/...[Red Hat research^],
OpenShift is used by 85% of Fortune 500 companies for container orchestration.
----

*Why:* References build credibility and allow learners to verify claims.

== Troubleshooting

=== Skill Doesn't Detect Existing Modules

*Problem:* Running `/create-lab --continue` but skill thinks it's new

*Cause:* Missing or incorrectly named files

*Solution:*

1. Check file naming: Must be `0X-module-YY-*.adoc` pattern
2. Ensure files are in `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`
3. Restart Claude Code session

=== Files Overwritten

*Problem:* Running skill overwrote my custom edits

*Cause:* Skill regenerated existing files

*Solution:*

* Back up content before running skills
* Use version control (git) to track changes
* If overwritten, recover from git: `git checkout HEAD -- filename.adoc`

=== Variable Extraction Fails

*Problem:* AgnosticV variables not detected

*Cause:* Catalog format doesn't match expected structure

*Solution:*

* Manually define variables in `partials/_attributes.adoc`
* Skip AgnosticV integration (answer "No" to RHDP question)
* Use placeholder attributes instead
