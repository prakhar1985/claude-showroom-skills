== What It Does

The `/create-demo` skill guides you through creating presenter-led demonstrations with:

* *Know/Show structure* (business context → technical demonstration)
* *Sequential questioning* (one question at a time, wait for answer)
* *Automatic file generation* (index, overview, details, modules)
* *Business impact focus* (ROI, metrics, competitive advantages)
* *Presenter guidance* (talk tracks, timing, Q&A preparation)
* *Mandatory conclusion* with consolidated references

== When to Use

Create presenter demos when you need:

* *Customer-facing demonstrations* for sales or field teams
* *Business value presentations* (not hands-on learning)
* *Executive briefings* with technical deep-dives
* *Competitive showcases* highlighting Red Hat advantages
* *Partner enablement* content for channel partners

[NOTE]
====
For learner-focused workshops, use link:create-lab.adoc[`/create-lab`] instead. Demos are presenter-focused; workshops are learner-focused.
====

== How Demos Differ from Workshops

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Aspect |Workshop (`/create-lab`) |Demo (`/create-demo`)

|*Audience*
|Learners (hands-on)
|Viewers (presenter-led)

|*Structure*
|Learning objectives + exercises
|Know (business) + Show (technical)

|*Verification*
|Mandatory checkpoints
|Optional (presenter handles live)

|*Troubleshooting*
|Required for learners
|Optional (presenter expertise assumed)

|*Focus*
|Skill building
|Business value + capabilities

|*Time*
|30-45 min per module
|10-15 min per module

|*Outcome*
|Learner can do it themselves
|Viewer understands value proposition
|===

== Before You Start

Have these materials ready:

* *Business scenario* (what customer problem does this solve?)
* *Value proposition* (why Red Hat, why now?)
* *Competitive differentiators* (how we're better than alternatives)
* *Target audience* (CxO, IT leaders, technical teams?)
* *Demo environment* details (live cluster, pre-recorded, hybrid)
* *Success metrics* (quantified business impact)

[TIP]
====
Demos lead with business value, not features. Prepare ROI data and customer success stories before starting.
====

== How to Use

=== Start New Demo Series

[source,bash]
----
# Navigate to your Showroom project
cd ~/showroom-my-demo

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Create first module
/create-demo --new
----

=== Continue Existing Demo

[source,bash]
----
# In same project directory
claude

# Add another module
/create-demo --continue
----

== The Workflow

The skill uses a *12-step sequential workflow* similar to `/create-lab`, but with demo-specific questions.

=== Step 0: Parse Command Arguments

*What happens:*

* Detects `--new` or `--continue` flag
* If no flag, asks whether this is a new demo or continuation

*Your input:*

* Nothing (if you used flags)
* OR answer: "This is a new demo" or "Continue existing demo"

=== Step 1: Determine Demo Status

*What happens:*

* For new demos: Proceeds to Step 2
* For continuations: Detects existing modules, skips to Step 3

*Automatic detection:*

----
Scanning content/modules/ROOT/pages/...
Found existing modules:
  ✓ 00-index.adoc
  ✓ 01-overview.adoc
  ✓ 02-details.adoc
  ✓ 03-module-01-value-prop.adoc

Detected: Continuation (will create module 04)
----

=== Step 2: Plan Overall Demo Story (New Only)

*What's asked:*

1. *Demo title*: What product/capability are you showcasing?
2. *Customer scenario*: What real-world problem are you solving?
3. *Business impact*: What quantified results can customers expect?
4. *Presentation arc*: How will the story unfold across modules?
5. *Target audience*: Who is the decision maker?

*Example answers:*

----
Title: "Accelerating AI Model Deployment with Red Hat OpenShift AI"
Customer scenario: "Global bank needs to deploy fraud detection models
                   faster while meeting regulatory compliance requirements"
Business impact: "Reduce model deployment time from weeks to hours,
                 improve fraud detection accuracy by 25%, ensure SOC2 compliance"
Presentation arc: "Module 1: Business challenge → Module 2: Solution demo →
                   Module 3: Results and ROI"
Target audience: "VP of Technology, Chief Data Officer, ML Engineering leads"
----

[NOTE]
====
The skill remembers this story for all subsequent modules. You don't need to repeat it.
====

=== Step 2.5: AgnosticV Catalog (Optional)

*What's asked:*

* "Are you creating this for Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP)?"

*If yes:*

* Skill helps generate `catalog.yaml` for AgnosticV
* Extracts variables from catalog for use in content
* Generates UUIDs for catalog entries

*If no:*

* Skips catalog generation
* Uses placeholder attributes instead

[TIP]
====
Most users select "No" unless deploying to RHDP. You can always add catalog later.
====

=== Step 3: Gather Module-Specific Details

*What's asked:*

1. *Module title*: What will you demonstrate in this section?
2. *Know section*: What business context must viewers understand?
3. *Show section*: What will the presenter demonstrate?
4. *Key messages*: What 3-5 takeaways should viewers remember?
5. *Estimated time*: How long will this module take to present?
6. *Competitive advantages*: How is Red Hat better than alternatives?

*Example answers:*

----
Module title: "Deploying AI Models at Scale"

Know section:
  - Traditional ML deployment takes 2-3 weeks per model
  - Regulatory requirements delay production releases
  - Manual deployment causes configuration drift

Show section:
  - Deploy fraud detection model in 5 minutes
  - Demonstrate automated compliance checks
  - Show real-time monitoring and rollback capabilities

Key messages:
  - Red Hat OpenShift AI reduces deployment time by 90%
  - Built-in compliance automation ensures SOC2/GDPR adherence
  - GitOps-based deployment eliminates configuration drift
  - Enterprise support de-risks production ML workloads

Time: 10-15 minutes
Competitive advantages:
  - AWS SageMaker requires vendor lock-in (Red Hat is hybrid cloud)
  - Azure ML lacks on-premises option (Red Hat supports edge)
  - Databricks has no Kubernetes integration (Red Hat native K8s)
----

=== Steps 4-7: Content Enhancement

*Step 4: Dynamic Variables*

* "What variables should be extracted?" (e.g., `{web_console_url}`, `{model_name}`)
* Variables go in `partials/_attributes.adoc`

*Step 5: Diagrams*

* "Will this module include diagrams?" (Yes/No)
* If yes: Describes where images should be placed

*Step 6: Troubleshooting*

* "Should we include troubleshooting section?" (Optional for demos)
* If yes: Documents common issues presenters might encounter

*Step 7: Presenter Notes*

* "What should presenters emphasize?" (Mandatory for demos)
* Talking points, timing cues, audience engagement tips

=== Step 8: Generate Files

*For first module* (`--new`):

Creates 4 files:

----
00-index.adoc           # Landing page with demo overview
01-overview.adoc        # Customer scenario and business impact
02-details.adoc         # Environment details and prerequisites
03-module-01-*.adoc     # First demonstration module
----

*For continuation* (`--continue`):

Creates 1 file:

----
04-module-02-*.adoc     # Next module in sequence
----

[WARNING]
====
Files are written directly to `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`. Back up existing content before running the skill!
====

=== Step 10: Update Navigation

*What happens:*

* Automatically updates `content/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc`
* Adds new module to navigation menu
* Maintains proper ordering

*Example nav.adoc update:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
* xref:00-index.adoc[Demo Home]
* xref:01-overview.adoc[Overview]
* xref:02-details.adoc[Technical Details]
* xref:03-module-01-value-prop.adoc[Module 1: Value Proposition]
* xref:04-module-02-technical-demo.adoc[Module 2: Technical Demo]  ← NEW
----

=== Step 12: Generate Conclusion Module

*What's asked* (when you're ready to finish):

* "Is this the final module?" (Yes/No)

*If yes:*

* Generates conclusion module (`0X-conclusion.adoc`)
* Consolidates ALL references from all modules
* Includes business impact summary
* Provides call-to-action (next steps for customers)
* Links to Red Hat sales resources and technical documentation

[NOTE]
====
Conclusion modules are *mandatory* in Red Hat demos. They wrap up the business case and provide clear next steps.
====

== Key Features

=== 1. Know/Show Methodology

[TIP]
====
Every demo module has two sections: *Know* (business context) and *Show* (technical demonstration). This ensures presenters lead with value, not features.
====

*Know section includes:*

* Customer pain points (backed by industry data)
* Business impact of the problem
* Why traditional approaches fail
* References to analyst reports or customer stories

*Show section includes:*

* Step-by-step demonstration instructions
* Presenter notes with talking points
* Timing cues for each step
* Audience engagement prompts
* Competitive differentiators

=== 2. Sequential Questioning

The skill asks *one question (or related group) at a time* and *waits for your answer*. This prevents overwhelming you with 20 questions at once.

*Example interaction:*

----
Skill: "What is the customer scenario for this demo?"
You: "Global bank struggles with slow ML deployment - takes 2-3 weeks
      per model, causing fraud detection delays"

Skill: "What quantified business impact can customers expect?"
You: "90% faster deployment, 25% better accuracy, $2M annual savings"

Skill: "What competitive advantages does Red Hat have?"
You: "Hybrid cloud (vs AWS lock-in), Kubernetes native (vs proprietary),
      compliance automation (vs manual processes)"
----

=== 3. Business Impact Focus

Unlike workshops, demos emphasize *ROI and business metrics*:

* Quantified improvements (percentages, dollars, time savings)
* Competitive advantages (why Red Hat vs alternatives)
* Customer success stories (proof points)
* Risk mitigation (compliance, support, vendor lock-in)

*Example metrics:*

* "Reduce deployment time by *90%* (weeks → hours)"
* "Save *$2M annually* in operational costs"
* "Improve fraud detection accuracy by *25%*"
* "Achieve *100% compliance* with SOC2/GDPR"

=== 4. Presenter Guidance

Every module includes detailed presenter notes:

*Timing cues:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.presenter-note]
****
*Timing*: 3 minutes for this section
****
----

*Talking points:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.presenter-note]
****
*Talking point*: "Notice how we can deploy from any source.
This flexibility prevents vendor lock-in, unlike AWS SageMaker."
****
----

*Audience engagement:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.presenter-note]
****
*Audience engagement*: Ask "How long does compliance review take
in your organization?" Highlight automation benefits.
****
----

=== 5. Competitive Positioning

Demos include comparison tables showing Red Hat advantages:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Feature |Red Hat |AWS |Azure |Google Cloud

|Hybrid Cloud
|✅
|❌
|❌
|❌

|Open Source
|✅
|❌
|❌
|❌

|No Lock-in
|✅

|❌
|❌
|===
----

== Best Practices

=== 1. Lead with Business Value, Not Features

*Don't start with features:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
Red Hat OpenShift AI has automated deployment pipelines,
compliance validation, and monitoring dashboards.
----

*Start with business impact:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
Global Financial Corp reduced model deployment time from 3 weeks to 4 hours,
saving $2M annually while ensuring SOC2 compliance.

How? Red Hat OpenShift AI automates deployment, compliance, and monitoring.
----

*Why:* Decision makers care about outcomes, not features.

=== 2. Quantify Everything

*Vague claims:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
Red Hat OpenShift AI is faster and more efficient.
----

*Quantified metrics:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
According to link:https://www.forrester.com/...[Forrester TEI Study^],
Red Hat OpenShift AI customers achieve:

* 90% reduction in deployment time
* 25% improvement in model accuracy
* $2.1M NPV over 3 years
* 6-month payback period
----

*Why:* Numbers build credibility and justify investment.

=== 3. Include Competitive Differentiators

Every module should answer: "Why Red Hat over AWS/Azure/Google?"

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Why Red Hat OpenShift AI?

* *Hybrid cloud*: Deploy on-premises, edge, or any cloud (AWS locks you into AWS)
* *Open source*: No vendor lock-in, full Kubernetes compatibility
* *Enterprise support*: 24x7 support included (AWS charges extra)
* *Compliance built-in*: Automated SOC2/GDPR validation (Azure requires manual config)
----

*Why:* Presenters need ammunition to handle objections.

=== 4. Prepare for Q&A

Include common objections and responses:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Anticipated Questions

*Q: "What about cost compared to AWS SageMaker?"*
A: While AWS appears cheaper initially, hidden costs (egress fees, support,
lock-in migration costs) make Red Hat 30% more cost-effective over 3 years.
See link:https://...[Forrester TEI Study^] for details.

*Q: "Can we migrate existing Azure ML workloads?"*
A: Yes. Red Hat OpenShift AI supports standard ONNX and TensorFlow formats.
Migration typically takes 2-4 weeks with Red Hat Consulting support.

*Q: "What about edge deployments?"*
A: Red Hat supports Single Node OpenShift (SNO) for edge locations.
AWS SageMaker requires full AWS infrastructure.
----

=== 5. Keep Modules Short (10-15 min)

*Too long (30 min module):*

* Covers 5 different capabilities
* Loses audience attention
* Hard to recover from technical issues

*Right size (10-15 min module):*

* 1-2 related capabilities
* Clear beginning and end
* Easy to skip or extend based on audience

*Why:* Shorter modules maintain engagement and provide flexibility.

== Troubleshooting

=== Skill Doesn't Detect Existing Modules

*Problem:* Running `/create-demo --continue` but skill thinks it's new

*Cause:* Missing or incorrectly named files

*Solution:*

1. Check file naming: Must be `0X-module-YY-*.adoc` pattern
2. Ensure files are in `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`
3. Restart Claude Code session

=== Business Impact Metrics Unclear

*Problem:* Unsure what quantified metrics to include

*Cause:* Lack of customer data or industry research

*Solution:*

* Use link:https://www.forrester.com[Forrester^] Total Economic Impact studies
* Reference link:https://www.gartner.com[Gartner^] industry reports
* Cite Red Hat customer success stories from link:https://www.redhat.com/en/success-stories[Red Hat website^]
* Use conservative estimates if customer data unavailable
* Include disclaimer: "Based on industry benchmarks" or "Typical customer results"

=== Competitive Positioning Unknown

*Problem:* Don't know how Red Hat compares to AWS/Azure

*Cause:* Unfamiliar with competitor offerings

*Solution:*

* Review Red Hat competitive battle cards (internal Sales resources)
* Consult Product Marketing team for latest positioning
* Use link:https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/openshift-vs-aws-overview[Red Hat comparison guides^]
* Focus on proven differentiators: hybrid cloud, open source, no lock-in
